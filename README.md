This project was sponsored by Columbus State and Dr. Zou.
Our group members were Owen Hartshorn, Logan Niemi, and Samuel Dzioba.
For this project we were tasked with creating a line following self driving robot using the provided materials. We created a 3 wheeled car about 250 x 150 x 100 mm. Our car uses an Elego board and the arduino IDE software, using inputs from 8 IR sensors, to control a motor driver which in turn controls 2 motors connected to wheels.
The car follows a line made of black electrical tape on white ground. It completes turns >80 deg, stops at the end of the line, and can complete multiple loops on a set course.
